## Design Principles

### 1. Core Accounting Stays Generic

The core accounting app handles only accounting primitives:
- Chart of Accounts (COA)
- Journal Entries (double-entry bookkeeping)
- Journal Templates (reusable transaction patterns)
- Template Execution (create journal entries from templates)
- Reports (trial balance, balance sheet, income statement, etc.)

### 2. Domain Logic Lives in Domain Apps

Industry-specific business rules stay in separate applications:

| Domain App | Owns |
|------------|------|
| Grant Management | Grants, budgets, compliance, fund restrictions |
| Inventory | Stock, COGS calculation, warehouse management |
| POS | Sales, receipts, daily settlement |
| Payroll (non-ID) | Country-specific payroll rules |
| Real Estate | Property, tenants, lease management |
| Manufacturing | BOM, work orders, production costing |

### 3. Integration via API

Domain apps call the accounting API to record financial transactions. Each domain app:
- Validates business rules locally
- Calls accounting API to create journal entries
- Handles failures with retry/SAF pattern

## Why Not Add Modules to This App?

### Technical Analysis: Current Journal Template Limitations

The current journal template system has structural limitations that prevent it from handling fund accounting patterns.

#### Current Data Model

```
JournalTemplate
├── templateName, category, cashFlowCategory
├── templateType (SIMPLE, MULTI_LINE, etc.)
└── lines: List<JournalTemplateLine>
        ├── account (ChartOfAccount)
        ├── position (DEBIT/CREDIT)
        ├── formula (e.g., "amount", "amount * 0.11")
        └── accountHint (for dynamic account selection)

JournalEntry
├── journalNumber, journalDate, status
├── account (single ChartOfAccount)
├── debitAmount, creditAmount
├── project (optional tracking dimension)
└── transaction (link to source transaction)
```

#### Why This Model Cannot Handle Fund Accounting

**1. Single Account Per Entry**

Each `JournalEntry` has exactly one `account` field. Fund accounting requires tracking **two dimensions** per entry:
- The natural account (e.g., "Equipment Expense 5.1.01")
- The fund (e.g., "NSF Grant 2024-001")

```
University expense example:
  Dr Equipment Expense (5.1.01) - Fund: NSF-2024-001  $50,000
  Cr Cash (1.1.01)              - Fund: NSF-2024-001  $50,000
```

The current model can record `account=5.1.01` but has no `fund` field. Adding optional `fund` field would:
- Require schema changes to `journal_entries` table
- Require nullable FK to a `funds` table
- Pollute the generic model with fund-specific concepts

**2. No Inter-Fund Transfer Pattern**

Fund accounting frequently requires inter-fund transfers:

```
Transfer from Operating Fund to Grant Fund:
  Dr Cash (1.1.01)    - Fund: NSF-2024-001  $100,000
  Cr Cash (1.1.01)    - Fund: Operating     $100,000
  (same account, different funds)
```

Current template model cannot express this because:
- Template lines are distinguished by `account` + `position`
- Two lines with same account and same position would be ambiguous
- No way to specify different fund for each line

**3. Template Formula Engine Limitations**

Current formula engine supports:
- Arithmetic: `amount`, `amount * 0.11`, `amount + fee`
- Variables: reference to input values

Fund accounting needs:
- Fund balance validation: `fund.availableBalance >= amount`
- Budget check: `fund.budget[category].remaining >= amount`
- Restriction check: `fund.isAllowable(expenseCategory)`

These are business rules, not mathematical formulas. Adding them to the template engine would:
- Turn templates into a programming language
- Make template creation complex for users
- Mix business logic with recording patterns

**4. Project Field is Not Equivalent to Fund**

The `JournalEntry.project` field might seem like a fund substitute, but:

| Aspect | Project | Fund |
|--------|---------|------|
| Purpose | Cost tracking/reporting | Balance tracking with restrictions |
| Balance | No balance concept | Must track fund balance |
| Restrictions | None | Expense type, time period, carry-forward rules |
| Reporting | Optional grouping | Mandatory segregated statements |

Projects are tags for cost allocation; funds are balance-tracking entities with rules.

**5. Schema Extension Alternatives Considered**

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Add nullable `fund_id` to `journal_entries` | Pollutes generic model; most entries would have NULL |
| Create `journal_entry_funds` junction table | Complex queries; still no validation logic |
| Add `dimensions` JSONB column | No referential integrity; query performance issues |
| Create fund-specific view layer | Still need underlying data model for fund balances |

#### Why Separate Accounts Per Fund Doesn't Work

One might consider creating separate COA accounts for each fund:

```
1.1.01.001  Cash - Operating Fund
1.1.01.002  Cash - NSF Grant 2024-001
1.1.01.003  Cash - Ford Foundation 2024
5.1.01.001  Equipment Expense - Operating Fund
5.1.01.002  Equipment Expense - NSF Grant 2024-001
...
```

This approach has significant problems:

**1. COA Explosion**

With 50 natural accounts and 20 active grants/funds: 50 × 20 = **1,000 accounts**. Each new grant requires creating 50+ new accounts. When grants end, dead accounts clutter the COA.

**2. No Enforcement of Fund Rules**

COA structure doesn't encode:
- Grant start/end dates (can't prevent posting to expired grant)
- Budget limits per category
- Allowable expense types
- Carry-forward rules

Users can freely post to any account. Business rules must live somewhere else.

**3. Cross-Fund Reporting Becomes Complex**

To answer "What is total Equipment Expense across all funds?":
- Must aggregate `5.1.01.001 + 5.1.01.002 + 5.1.01.003 + ...`
- Requires maintaining a mapping table of which accounts roll up to which natural account
- Report queries become complex joins

**4. Template Maintenance Nightmare**

Each template would need variants per fund, or dynamic account selection becomes extremely complex. Current `accountHint` mechanism isn't designed for this scale.

**5. Fund Transfer Loses Semantic Meaning**

Inter-fund transfer requires 2 different accounts even though conceptually it's the same account (Cash):
```
Dr Cash-GrantA    $100,000
Cr Cash-Operating $100,000
```

This works mechanically but loses the semantic meaning that both are "Cash".

### Fund Accounting Example

Universities need to track restricted vs unrestricted funds. This requires:

| Requirement | Can Template Solve? | Why Not? |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| Track balance by fund | No | Need fund dimension on every journal line |
| Validate fund restrictions | No | Need business logic, not just math |
| Fund-based reporting | No | Need additional query dimension |

### Grant Accounting Example

Grants have compliance rules:

| Requirement | Can Template Solve? | Why Not? |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| Budget enforcement | No | Need budget tracking per category |
| Cost allowability | No | Need policy rules engine |
| Grant lifecycle | No | Need status, dates, workflow |
| Compliance reporting | No | Need grant-specific report formats |

**Conclusion:** Templates are recording mechanisms. Fund/grant accounting requires tracking dimensions, validation rules, and compliance logic that don't belong in a generic accounting system. A separate Grant Management app that owns fund/grant business logic and calls the accounting API for journal recording is the correct architectural separation.

### When Universities Can Use This App Directly

Not all universities require fund accounting. If a university operates 100% on student tuition (no grants, no restricted funds), the current app handles it with standard templates.

#### Tuition-Only University Pattern

This is essentially the same as a regular service business:

```
Tuition Revenue:
  Dr Cash/Bank (1.1.01)           Rp 50,000,000
  Cr Tuition Revenue (4.1.01)     Rp 50,000,000

Operating Expenses:
  Dr Salary Expense (5.1.01)      Rp 30,000,000
  Cr Cash/Bank (1.1.01)           Rp 30,000,000
```

No fund dimension needed. One pool of money, standard double-entry.

#### What Current App Already Provides for Universities

| Requirement | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Track tuition by program/faculty | Use `Project` field (e.g., "Faculty of Engineering") |
| Departmental cost tracking | Use `Project` field or COA sub-accounts |
| Payroll (Indonesian) | Phase 3 already complete |
| Financial reports | Standard trial balance, income statement, balance sheet |

#### Decision Matrix: When Grant/Fund Module is Required

| Scenario | Need Separate Module? |
|----------|----------------------|
| 100% tuition, single pool | No |
| 100% tuition, track by faculty (reporting only) | No - use Project |
| Tuition + government grants with restrictions | Yes |
| Tuition + research grants with compliance | Yes |
| Tuition + endowment funds | Yes |
| Tuition + scholarship funds (restricted) | Yes |

#### The Key Question

> "Can money be freely moved between purposes, or are there restrictions?"

- **No restrictions** → Current app works
- **Has restrictions** → Need fund accounting module

Most private universities that rely solely on tuition fees operate like regular businesses. The fund accounting complexity comes from external funding sources with strings attached (government grants, research funding, donor-restricted scholarships, endowments).

### Home Industry / Hobby Sellers

Home industries (e.g., housewives selling homemade cakes via Instagram) have simple transaction patterns that the current app fully supports.

#### Typical Transaction Patterns

```
Buy ingredients:
  Dr Supplies Expense (5.1.01)     Rp 200,000
  Cr Cash (1.1.01)                 Rp 200,000

Sell cakes via Instagram:
  Dr Cash/Bank (1.1.01)            Rp 500,000
  Cr Sales Revenue (4.1.01)        Rp 500,000
```

#### Why This App Works for Home Industry

The perceived complexity barrier (double-entry, debit/credit) is abstracted away:

| Perceived Barrier | How App Solves It |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| No accounting knowledge | Pre-configured templates crafted by experts |
| Don't understand debit/credit | User sees "Beli Bahan" or "Terima Pembayaran", not journal entries |
| Too busy to do bookkeeping | Telegram OCR: send receipt photo → auto-post transaction |
| Just want to know profit | Income statement report shows monthly profit |

#### User Experience

The user doesn't interact with accounting concepts:

1. **Template-based input**: Select transaction type → fill amount → submit
2. **Telegram OCR**: Send receipt photo to bot → transaction auto-posted
3. **Reports**: View monthly income statement for profit/loss

#### Growth Path Without Migration

```
Hobby Stage (Rp 0-5M/month)
  → Basic templates: Buy supplies, Receive payment
  → Telegram OCR for receipts

Growing (Rp 5-50M/month)
  → More templates: Packaging, Delivery, Equipment
  → Track by product using Project field

UMKM Threshold (>Rp 500M/year)
  → Tax reporting becomes mandatory
  → Complete records already exist
  → No system migration needed
```

#### Fit Analysis

| Requirement | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| No accounting knowledge | Pre-configured templates hide complexity |
| Quick transaction entry | Template selection + amount only |
| Receipt-based recording | Telegram OCR auto-posts |
| Monthly profit tracking | Income statement report |
| Tax compliance (when needed) | Already built-in |
| Scale to formal business | No migration needed |

**Key insight:** Complexity is in the setup (done by experts), not in daily use. The app targets any business that needs financial records, from hobby sellers to established SMEs.

#### Production Accounting Limitations

Home industries involve production (raw materials → finished goods). The current app has limitations in this area:

**What Current App Can Do:**

| Activity | Supported? | How |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Buy raw materials | ✅ | Template: expense or asset |
| Record sales | ✅ | Template: sales revenue |
| Marketing expenses | ✅ | Template: expense |
| Packaging costs | ✅ | Template: expense |
| Delivery costs | ✅ | Template: expense |
| Simple COGS (periodic) | ✅ | Monthly adjustment template |
| Track raw material quantities | ❌ | No inventory module |
| Track WIP | ❌ | No production module |
| Calculate perpetual COGS | ❌ | No inventory valuation |
| BOM costing | ❌ | No BOM module |

**What Current App Cannot Do:**

1. **Inventory Quantity Tracking** - App tracks monetary amounts only, not quantities (e.g., "Flour: 10 kg @ Rp 15,000")

2. **WIP (Work in Progress)** - Manufacturing flow (Raw Material → WIP → Finished Goods → COGS) requires production orders, cost accumulation, and inventory stage transfers

3. **Perpetual COGS** - Calculating accurate COGS per sale requires inventory valuation (FIFO/weighted average)

**COGS Methods:**

| Method | Description | Current App |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Periodic | Estimate COGS, adjust at period end | ✅ Supported |
| Perpetual | Calculate COGS per sale based on actual cost | ❌ Needs inventory system |

For simple home industry with consistent recipes, periodic method works:
```
Monthly COGS adjustment:
  Dr COGS (5.1.01)               Rp 2,000,000
  Cr Supplies Expense (5.1.02)   Rp 2,000,000
```

**Decision Matrix:**

| Business Complexity | Current App? |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Single product, consistent recipe | ✅ Yes |
| Few products, estimate costs | ✅ Yes (periodic COGS) |
| Many products, need accurate costing | ❌ Need inventory module |
| Actual manufacturing with WIP | ❌ Need manufacturing module |

**When to Upgrade:** When the business needs to track inventory quantities, calculate per-product profitability accurately, or manage actual manufacturing processes with WIP tracking.

#### Why Inventory/Production Should Be Inbuilt Module

Unlike fund accounting, production/inventory transactions fit the current journal template model without architectural changes.

**Transaction Pattern Compatibility:**

```
Purchase raw materials:
  Dr Raw Materials Inventory (1.1.05)   Rp 500,000
  Cr Cash (1.1.01)                      Rp 500,000

Transfer to production:
  Dr WIP (1.1.06)                       Rp 300,000
  Cr Raw Materials Inventory (1.1.05)   Rp 300,000

Complete production:
  Dr Finished Goods (1.1.07)            Rp 400,000
  Cr WIP (1.1.06)                       Rp 400,000

Sale with COGS:
  Dr Cash (1.1.01)                      Rp 600,000
  Cr Sales Revenue (4.1.01)             Rp 600,000

  Dr COGS (5.1.01)                      Rp 400,000
  Cr Finished Goods (1.1.07)            Rp 400,000
```

No new dimension needed on journal entries. Standard debit/credit to existing accounts.

**Comparison: Fund Accounting vs Inventory/Production**

| Aspect | Fund Accounting | Inventory/Production |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| New dimension on journal entry? | Yes (fund_id) | No |
| Complex validation rules? | Yes (restrictions, budgets, dates) | No (just quantity math) |
| Separate balance tracking? | Yes (per-fund balances) | No (uses existing COA balances) |
| External compliance? | Yes (grant terms) | No |
| Architectural change needed? | Yes | No |

**Conclusion:** Inventory/Production should be an inbuilt module (like Payroll and Fixed Assets), not a separate app. This keeps the home industry growth path entirely within the app with no migration needed.

**Proposed Module Structure:**

```
New Entities:
├── Product (name, unit, BOM optional)
├── InventoryTransaction (product, qty, unit_cost, type)
├── InventoryBalance (product, qty, total_cost)
└── ProductionOrder (optional, for WIP tracking)

New Services:
├── InventoryService (track quantities, calculate FIFO/avg cost)
├── COGSCalculator (compute cost when selling)
└── ProductionService (optional, for WIP)

Integration:
├── When sale recorded → auto-calculate COGS → create journal entries
├── When purchase recorded → update inventory balance
└── Uses existing Transaction + JournalEntry entities
```

See Phase 5 in `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` for implementation details.

## Integration Pattern: Store and Forward (SAF)

### Why SAF?

Distributed transactions are complex. Instead of two-phase commit, we use eventual consistency:

```
Domain App                          Accounting API
    │
    ├── 1. Validate business rules locally
    ├── 2. Save to local SAF queue (status=PENDING)
    ├── 3. POST to Accounting API
    │       ├── Success → Update SAF status=COMPLETED
    │       └── Failure → Keep PENDING, retry later
    │
    └── 4. Background job retries PENDING entries
```

### Benefits

- Domain app is source of truth for domain data
- Accounting app is source of truth for journal entries
- Each system owns its domain
- Failures don't block business operations
- Retry handles transient failures

### Idempotency

Critical for SAF pattern. Client generates unique key per transaction:

```json
POST /api/transactions
{
    "idempotencyKey": "grant-app-2024-001-expense-123",
    ...
}
```

If client retries same request, server returns existing transaction instead of creating duplicate.

{
    "idempotencyKey": "grant-app-2024-001-expense-123",
    "templateCode": "EXPENSE-CASH",
    "transactionDate": "2024-12-03",
    "description": "Lab equipment purchase - Grant NSF-2024-001",
    "amount": 50000000,
    "variables": {
        "expenseAccount": "5.1.01",
        "cashAccount": "1.1.01"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "sourceSystem": "grant-app",
        "sourceId": "expense-123",
        "grantNumber": "NSF-2024-001"
    }
}
```

    "message": "Template with code 'INVALID-CODE' not found",
    "timestamp": "2024-12-03T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

Simple approach for server-to-server communication:

```
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

API keys are:
- Generated per client application
- Stored hashed in database
- Scoped to specific permissions (read-only, read-write)
- Rotatable without downtime

### OAuth2 (Future)

For more complex scenarios:
- Multiple client apps with different permissions
- User-context API calls
- Token refresh and revocation

## Domain App Integration Examples

### University Grant Management

```
Grant App validates:
- Grant is active (start date <= today <= end date)
- Cost category is allowable
- Budget has sufficient balance
- Expense complies with grant terms

Then calls Accounting API:
POST /api/transactions
{
    "templateCode": "GRANT-EXPENSE",
    "amount": 50000000,
    "variables": {
        "expenseAccount": "5.1.01.001",  // Lab Equipment
        "fundAccount": "1.1.01.003"       // Grant Bank Account
    }
}
```

### Retail Inventory

```
Inventory App calculates:
- COGS using FIFO/weighted average
- Inventory valuation adjustment

Then calls Accounting API:
POST /api/transactions
{
    "templateCode": "COGS-RECOGNITION",
    "amount": 15000000,
    "variables": {
        "cogsAccount": "5.1.01",
        "inventoryAccount": "1.1.05"
    }
}
```

### Restaurant POS

```
POS App calculates:
- Daily sales total
- Payment method breakdown
- Tips distribution

Then calls Accounting API:
POST /api/transactions
{
    "templateCode": "DAILY-SALES",
    "amount": 25000000,
    "variables": {
        "cashAccount": "1.1.01",
        "salesAccount": "4.1.01",
        "taxPayable": "2.1.03"
    }
}
```

## Deployment Options

### Single Instance (Small Business)

- One accounting instance
- Domain apps call same instance
- Simplest deployment

### Multi-Tenant (SaaS)

- Single accounting instance with tenant isolation
- Each tenant has own COA, templates, data
- API key scoped to tenant

### Dedicated Instance (Enterprise)

- Separate accounting instance per customer
- Full data isolation
- Custom configuration per instance

## What Stays in Core App

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| COA Management | Core | UI + API |
| Journal Templates | Core | UI + API |
| Template Execution | Core | API primary |
| Journal Entries | Core | Created via templates |
| Basic Reports | Core | UI + API |
| Payroll (ID) | Optional Module | Indonesian-specific |
| Tax Compliance (ID) | Optional Module | Indonesian-specific |

## What Becomes Domain Apps

| Domain | Features |
|--------|----------|
| Grant Management | Grants, funds, budgets, compliance |
| Inventory | Stock, COGS, warehouses |
| POS | Sales, receipts, shifts |
| Payroll (non-ID) | Country-specific rules |
| Fixed Assets | Depreciation, disposal (could stay in core) |
| Budgeting | Budget vs actual (could stay in core) |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: API Foundation

1. Add REST API controllers for core operations
2. Implement idempotency key on Transaction entity
3. Add API key authentication
4. Generate OpenAPI documentation
5. Integration tests for API endpoints

### Phase 2: API Enhancements

1. Report API endpoints
2. Pagination and filtering
3. Rate limiting
4. Audit logging for API calls
5. API versioning strategy

### Phase 3: Reference Domain App

1. Build simple domain app as reference implementation
2. Demonstrate SAF pattern
3. Document integration patterns
4. Provide client SDK (optional)

## Success Criteria

1. Domain apps can record transactions without knowing accounting details
2. Accounting app has no industry-specific code
3. Adding new industry requires only new domain app + templates
4. API handles failures gracefully with idempotency
5. Reports aggregate all transactions regardless of source

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API performance | Async processing, caching |
| Data consistency | Idempotency keys, SAF pattern |
| Security | API keys, rate limiting, audit logs |
| Complexity | Good documentation, reference implementations |
| Version compatibility | API versioning, deprecation policy |
