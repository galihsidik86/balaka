## PKP vs Non-PKP Handling

### Non-PKP (Not VAT Registered)
- No PPN separation in transactions
- Templates without PPN lines
- Record gross amounts only
- Cannot claim PPN Masukan
- Simpler reporting

**Example Transaction:**
```
Template: "Pembelian (Non-PKP)"
Lines:
1. Debit  | Beban              | full_amount
2. Credit | Kas/Bank           | full_amount
```

### PKP (VAT Registered)
- Must separate DPP and PPN
- Issue Faktur Pajak for sales
- Collect input tax invoices for purchases
- Monthly PPN reporting
- e-Faktur compliance (future)

**Tenant Configuration:**
```
tenants table:
- is_pkp: boolean
  → Determines which templates are available
  → Enables/disables PPN features
  → Shows/hides PPN accounts
```

## Integration Points (Future Phases)

### e-Faktur Integration
- Generate e-Faktur XML from sales transactions
- Import e-Faktur from purchases
- Upload to DJP portal
- Status tracking (approved, rejected)

### e-Bupot Integration
- Generate Bukti Potong electronically
- Submit to DJP system
- Track certificate status

### e-Filing Integration
- Auto-fill SPT forms
- Submit directly to DJP
- Retrieve filing confirmation
