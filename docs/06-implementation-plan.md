# Implementation Plan

## Guiding Principles

1. **Go Live Fast** - MVP with core features only, add incrementally
2. **No Breaking Changes** - Database migrations must be backward compatible
3. **Feature Flags** - New features behind toggles until stable
4. **Data Safety** - Production data must never be corrupted or lost

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
