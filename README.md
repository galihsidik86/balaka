## Technology Stack

### Core Stack

**Runtime:**
- Java 25 (LTS with virtual threads)

**Backend:**
- Spring Boot 4.0
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf (template engine)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
- HTMX (partial page updates)
- Alpine.js (lightweight interactivity)
- Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 17

**Document Storage:**
- Phase 1: MinIO (self-hosted, S3-compatible)
- Phase 2+: Indonesian cloud (Biznet Gio, IDCloudHost) or AWS S3/GCS

### Development & Testing

**Local Development:**
- Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration)

**Infrastructure:**
- Current: Docker Compose + manual provisioning
- Future: Pulumi (programmatic VPS provisioning for SaaS)

**Testing:**
- JUnit 5 + Mockito (unit tests)
- Testcontainers (integration tests)
- Playwright (functional/E2E tests)
- K6 (performance testing)

**DevSecOps:**
- SonarQube (SAST)
- OWASP Dependency-Check (dependency vulnerabilities)
- OWASP ZAP (DAST)
- Trivy (container security)
- GitLeaks (secret scanning)

### Architecture: Modern Monolith

**Why not split Backend/Frontend?**
- Single codebase reduces complexity
- No data model or validation duplication
- Simple session-based authentication
- Faster development for accounting workflows
- HTMX provides modern UX without SPA overhead

See [Technology Stack Documentation](docs/05-technology-stack.md) for detailed justification and DevSecOps pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 25**
  - Linux/macOS: [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) - `sdk install java 25-open`
  - Windows: [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Docker** - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`) is included in the project.

## Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run specific test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountServiceTest
```

### Functional Tests (Playwright)

Functional tests use Playwright for browser automation. They require Docker for Testcontainers (PostgreSQL).

```bash
# Run all functional tests (headless)
./mvnw test -Dtest=**/functional/*Test

# Run specific functional test
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest
```

**Playwright Configuration Options:**

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `playwright.headless` | `true` | Run browser in headless mode |
| `playwright.slowmo` | `0` | Delay between actions in milliseconds |

```bash
# Run with visible browser
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest -Dplaywright.headless=false

# Run with visible browser and slow motion (useful for debugging)
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=100
```
